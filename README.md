Tired of checking the VTU Website everyday for your results?
The curiosity killing you?
Use this script and stop worrying about it (until it comes, of course).

----------


Prerequisite
-------------------


* **$ git clone** the repository.

	` $ git clone https://github.com/abhijith0505/VTU-Result-Notifier.git`

* Install the required modules using,

	`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

> If you do not have pip installed, install it using:  
	> `$ easy_install pip`

 

Usage
-------------------

- Sign up for a free twilio account from http://twilio.com. You will be assigned with an account sid and auth token. You may also have to verify the mobile number to which you will send the message. Once this is successful, you will also get a sender twilio mobile number that can be used in your code.

- Follow the comments present in the file to set up the script to send the SMS to your number.


> **Note:**
        The script has to be executed regularly for it to check the website and send the SMS. For this to happen, schedule the execution of this script using a **crontab**. (Redirect errors to /dev/null to keep terminal clean)
> Example:
> `* * * * * python resultScraper.py 2>/dev/null`

----------
> **Note:**
        The free twilio account allows practically unlimited SMS to your own verified number. However, if you want to send SMS to other numbers, you have to upgrade to a paid plan.
